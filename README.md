# I'm reading Python Crash Course *third edition by: Eric Matthes
# My goal is to document my progress on github
# I've been using www.boot.dev and infact finished the python lessons, however when
# I venture onto more challenging lesson or try my hand at projects, I hit too many
# hurdles for me to feel confident moving forward. And so here am, starting again.
# However this time, I'm adding transparencey and accountability by documenting here.
